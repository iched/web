        <p>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) stands as one of the most critical challenges to global health today and is a leading cause of antibiotic treatment failure. When confronted with antibiotic therapy, the robust polymeric matrix of bacterial biofilms often restricts antibiotic penetration.<sup>[1]</sup> Furthermore, persister cells within biofilms typically cease proliferation and reduce metabolic activity to conserve energy, thereby ensuring their survival.<sup>[2]</sup> Additionally, bacteria increase the production of hydrogen sulfide gas in response to stress and damage, which helps them combat oxidative stress and enhances their antibiotic tolerance. <sup>[3]</sup></p>

      <p>We have successfully designed antibiotic-nanozymes constructed via axial coordination and supramolecular self-assembly, utilizing a range of antibiotics including Gentamicin and Fluconazole, along with hemin. In this system, the antibiotic acts as a structural scaffold, enabling targeting of intracellular sites and exerting its inherent antimicrobial mechanism. Simultaneously, hemin serves as the catalytic center, efficiently generating ROS to disrupt bacterial biofilms and their antioxidant defense systems. The synergistic integration of these two components forms a functionally unified composite material, achieving a powerful antibacterial effect where "1+1 >> 2," effectively overcoming the resistance issues associated with traditional antibiotics.</p>

This study leverages this characteristic by using antibiotic molecules to replace the protein scaffold and the role of histidine in natural enzymes, allowing them to axially coordinate with hemin and spontaneously self-assemble into nanozyme structures with enzyme-like activity.</p>

The top two antibiotics with the highest predicted affinity were selected for further assembly with hemin into antibiotic-nanozymes, followed by experimental validation. The experimental results showed that nanozymes constructed from antibiotics with higher binding affinity exhibited stronger peroxidase (POD)-like activity and bactericidal efficacy. Computational virtual screening enables the rapid and accurate prediction of antibiotics with high binding affinity to hemin, facilitating the construction of high-performance nanozymes, saving time and economic costs, and significantly shortening the research and development cycle.</p>

      <p><strong>Functional Mechanism: Multi-mechanistic Synergy to Reverse Resistance</strong></p>
      <p>The antibiotic-hemin nanozymes developed in this study combat drug-resistant bacteria through synergistic multi-mechanisms. Their core function relies on their peroxidase-like activity, catalyzing the conversion of endogenous H₂O₂ into highly toxic ·OH radicals, which disrupts the bacterial redox homeostasis and consequently reverses resistance. Simultaneously, they degrade the biofilm matrix and eradicate persister cells. Furthermore, this system can induce fungal ferroptosis, inhibit efflux pumps, and suppress the H₂S-based antioxidant defense system, comprehensively enhancing the bactericidal effect. This bioinspired synergistic strategy provides an efficient new approach to overcoming antibiotic resistance, holding broad prospects for clinical application.</p>
