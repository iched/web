          <p>In ancient wooden structures, the mortise-and-tenon joint has been widely utilized owing to its remarkable mechanical strength, durability, structural simplicity, and aesthetic refinement. A defining characteristic of this joint system is its interlocking mechanism, in which one component features a projecting tenon and the other a precisely shaped mortise. Upon assembly, the tenon fits tightly into the mortise, forming a secure and stable connection without reliance on external fasteners. </p>

            <p>Hemin, an essential molecule in the human body, serves as a cofactor in numerous enzymatic reactions and plays a pivotal role in the transport of gaseous molecules<sup>[2]</sup>. In cytochromes (cyt), heme undergoes axial coordination with specific amino acid residues. These axial ligands are crucial for modulating the structural and functional properties of hemoproteins, including redox potential, electronic configuration, spin state, electron transfer rate, and catalytic activity<sup>[3]</sup>.</p>

          <p>So far, we have successfully constructed a series of antibiotic nanozymes through the axial coordination between heme and different representative antibiotics, such as gentamicin (GM) and fluconazole (FCZ), designated as GM(Hemin) and FCZ(Hemin), respectively. Notably, each nanozyme exhibits a consistent capacity to reverse antimicrobial resistance.</p>
          <P>Taking GM(Hemin) as an example, this assembly effectively eradicates biofilms by degrading glutathione (GSH) within the biofilm matrix. Subsequently, by leveraging its peroxidase (POD)-like activity, GM(Hemin) generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), which promote bacterial lipid peroxidation and compromise membrane integrity. Additionally, it could induce intracellular ROS accumulation, thereby enhancing the efficacy of co-administered antibiotics. The antibacterial strategy activates ferroptosis-like pathways, resulting in significant suppression of bacterial viability.</P>
          <P>Similarly, FCZ(Hemin) could function as a ferroptosis inducer. This process enhances fungal ferroptosis, thereby improving the antimicrobial efficacy of FCZ. The free radicals generated by FCZ(Hemin)-catalyzed reactions further increase intracellular ROS levels, leading to amplified ferroptosis and increased antibiotic uptake in drug-resistant fungal strains.</P>
