                <p>Abstract: Based on the proposed development of antibiotic nanozymes‚Äîa novel strategy integrating antibiotics with nanozyme structures to combat drug-resistant bacteria through a synergistic multi-mechanistic approach. Its core function relies on its peroxidase-like activity, catalyzing the conversion of endogenous H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ into highly toxic ¬∑OH radicals, which disrupts bacterial redox homeostasis and thereby reverses resistance. Simultaneously, they degrade the biofilm matrix and eradicate persister cells. Furthermore, this system can induce fungal ferroptosis, inhibit efflux pumps, and suppress the H‚ÇÇS-based antioxidant defense system, comprehensively enhancing bactericidal efficacy‚Äîthis research thoroughly examines its ethical, legal, social, sustainability, and safety implications. We are committed to responsible innovation, emphasizing comprehensive biosafety and ecotoxicological evaluation, regulatory compliance, equitable access, public engagement, and stringent laboratory and environmental safety protocols to ensure the technology is developed and applied in a scientifically sound, ethically acceptable, and socially beneficial manner.</p>

As an endogenous substance in the human body‚Äîfor instance, the core component of hemoglobin‚Äîits metabolic pathways are well-characterized and tightly regulated. Compared to non-biodegradable inorganic nanomaterials (e.g., metal oxides), hemin-based nanozymes exhibit inherent biocompatibility and predictable metabolic profiles at the molecular level, greatly mitigating the potential long-term toxicity risks linked to their persistent accumulation in vivo.</p>
