                <p>Antibiotics contain diverse functional groups—such as imidazole, amino, hydroxyl, phenyl, and pyridine moieties—that can effectively displace chloride ions in hemin and serve as axial ligands to the Fe–N₄ planar center, forming a pentacoordinated structure. These units can further self-assemble into nanoaggregates through various non-covalent interactions, including hydrogen bonding, salt bridges, π–π stacking, and cation-π interactions, ultimately leading to the co-assembly of antibiotic-integrated nanozymes.</p>
