                <p>What’s more,using benzene ring-containing antibiotics as an example, we initially predicted and ranked the affinity between various antibiotics and chlorinated heme. Benzylpenicillin (BPN) exhibited the strongest affinity, while polymyxin B (PB) showed the weakest. When comparing the assembled products of these two antibiotics with chlorinated heme, PB failed to form a Soret band, indicating its inability to establish axial coordination and a catalytic active center. As a result, PB (Hemin) does not enhance the bactericidal activity of PB.</p>

            <p>GM(Hemin) effectively eradicates biofilms primarily. Subsequently, leveraging its peroxidase (POD)-like activity, GM(Hemin) generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) that enhance bacterial lipid peroxidation, disrupt membrane permeability.What’s more,it elevates intracellular ROS levels to potentiating antibiotic efficacy. Additionally, the antibiotic nanozyme may inflict physical damage on bacterial cells , leading to protein leakage. Together, these mechanisms form a multifaceted antibacterial strategy that enhances ferroptosis-like pathways to suppress bacterial survival.</p>

            <p>The FCZ (Hemin) demonstrated significantly enhanced antibacterial efficacy in the absence of ferroptosis inhibitor, which was abolished upon inhibitor addition. These findings indicate ferric porphyrin reduction to ferrous heme acts as a ferroptosis inducer that intensifies fungal ferroptosis, thereby boosting antimicrobial efficacy.</p>

            <p>FCZ(Hemin) acts as a ferroptosis inducer. This process enhances fungal ferroptosis, thereby improving the antimicrobial efficacy of fluconazole (FCZ).The free radicals generated by FCZ(Hemin) catalysis further elevate intracellular ROS levels, thereby promoting enhanced ferroptosis. </p>

            <p>This study successfully synthesized a series of antibiotic nanozymes by co-assembling various antibiotics with hemin via a coordination-precipitation method. Morphological characterization revealed that the synthesized antibiotic nanozymes possessed relatively uniform particle sizes. Molecular docking simulations further confirmed the theoretical feasibility of their structures. Subsequently, using gentamicin nanozymes and fluconazole nanozymes as representative examples, their antibacterial effects were systematically investigated. Through growth curve assays, electron microscopy, and protein leakage experiments, we validated their ability to inhibit the growth and viability of planktonic bacteria, demonstrating potent antibacterial properties.Further mechanistic studies revealed that the peroxidase (POD)-like activity of the nanozymes generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), as confirmed by fluorescent staining, which contribute to bacterial damage and death. Additionally, membrane potential assays and lipid peroxidation measurements verified membrane permeabilization and damage induced by the gentamicin nanozyme. The use of a ferroptosis inhibitor confirmed that the fluconazole nanozyme enhances its antibacterial efficacy primarily through the ferroptosis pathway.</p>
            <p>Based on these collective findings, antibiotic nanozymes effectively eradicate drug-resistant bacteria and exhibit superior performance compared to conventional antibiotics. In conclusion, antibiotic nanozymes represent a promising class of candidates that optimize antibiotic efficacy, effectively target both planktonic bacteria and biofilms, and can serve as potential alternatives to current antibiotics in bacterial treatment. Moreover, their applicability to various antibiotics and the flexibility in ligand design underscore their broad utility and generalizability.</p>
